# PowerShell Lab: Bulk Active Directory User Management (CSV)
## Overview
This repo archives a BCIT in-class PowerShell lab for:
- Bulk **AD user creation** from CSV
- Bulk **AD user deletion** from CSV

For public sharing, the sample uses placeholders like `example.local` and a template CSV.

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/bulkusers_create.ps1`
- `scripts/bulkusers_delete.ps1`
- `data/bulkusers.template.csv`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`

## Requirements
- Windows + **RSAT ActiveDirectory module**
- Permissions to create/delete users in the target OU/container

## CSV Template
File: `data/bulkusers.template.csv`  
Header:
```csv
firstname,lastname,username,password,email,streetaddress,city,state,country,department,telephone,jobtitle,company,ou
```
Minimum fields:
- `username`
- `password` (create)
- `ou` (DN path like CN=Users,DC=example,DC=local)

Template values:
- password uses CHANGEME
- domain placeholders use example.local / DC=example,DC=local

To run in your lab domain (e.g., ryohei.lab), update:
- create script UPN suffix (example.local → your domain)
- CSV ou DN (DC=example,DC=local → your domain DN)

CSV path in scripts
- Both scripts read the template CSV from:
```
$CSVPath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot "..\data\bulkusers.template.csv"
```

## How to Run
From repo root:
Create users:
```
.\scripts\bulkusers_create.ps1
```

Delete users (destructive):
```
.\scripts\bulkusers_delete.ps1
```

Safer delete test:
```
Remove-ADUser -Identity $Username -WhatIf
```

## Scripts
### Bulk Create Users
```
.\bulkusers_create.ps1
```
Expected behavior:
- If a user already exists (SamAccountName matches), it is skipped with a warning.
- If not, the user is created and counted.
- A summary prints at the end.

### Bulk Delete Users (only if your delete script is included)
```
.\bulkusers_delete.ps1
```
Expected behavior:
- Script checks existence using:
  - Get-ADUser -LDAPFilter "(sAMAccountName=$Username)"
- If user exists, it deletes using:
  - Remove-ADUser -Identity $Username -Confirm:$false
- If user does not exist, it is skipped with a warning.
- A summary prints at the end.

## Safety Notes
- `bulkusers_delete.ps1` permanently deletes accounts (no recycle bin restore in many lab setups).
- If you want a safer test run, temporarily change the delete line to include `-WhatIf`:
```
Remove-ADUser -Identity $Username -WhatIf
```
Then remove `-WhatIf` when you are ready.

## What I Practiced / Learned
- `Import-Csv`, `New-ADUser`, `Remove-ADUser`
- Existence checks before create/delete
- Working with OU/CN Distinguished Names
- Counters + summary output

## Disclaimer
Educational/lab use only. Do not upload real passwords or production data to a public repository.
